			When I went to KFC last time, I wanted to make it myself. I just love to study how to do it in addition to eating. I asked a friend in Beijing that she said that the chicken roll sweet noodle sauce and green onion are the soul. So according to the method she said, I did it once. It was exactly the same as the one I went to Beijing to eat. I ate burritos and started to sigh; how could life be so good.
